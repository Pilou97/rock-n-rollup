# Rock-n-rollup

Wow, you find this framework, that means you are intrigued with this _awesome_ framework.

Let me introduce this framework for you.

Rock-n-rollup is an **opiniated** framework to develop [smart rollups](https://tezos.gitlab.io/nairobi/smart_rollups.html) on Tezos.
The goal of this framework is to ease the development of smart rollups for Rust developers. That's why this framework looks like actix/axum/bevy. We decided to use the "dependency injection at runtime pattern".

When you develop a webserver, you will develop what you call endpoint or routes, for smart rollup it's the same way but it's named _transition_.

In addition, this framework comes with many useful plugins to help you implement your deepest desires.

Finnaly, this framework also comes with tooling to setup/deploy your rollup.
